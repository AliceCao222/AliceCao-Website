        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm Vietnamese since my parents are both Vietnamese. However, I was born in Japan. Then, I migrate from Japan to the United States. Even though I was able to speak Japanese when I arrived in the US, I did not know how to speak Vietnamese because Vietnamese was common in Japan and I could communicate with others without using Vietnamese. Since I was not able to speak both Vietnamese and English, I was only able to speak with my family and it was hard to communicate with relatives and friends. I was having difficulties learning both languages and adapting in the environment surrounding me. Although I am not perfectly fluent, I am able to understand the languages: Japanese, Vietnamese, and English. Since when I was little, I always helped translate one language to another language. This is an ability that I feel proud of and I gained through my hard work.<br><br>

        When I was in high school, I was joining my clubs. This helped me to improve my leadership skills and to gain my experience. My toughest year was senior year because I was an officer in three different clubs: president in Japanese Culture Club, secretary in Paper Airplanes, and treasurer in Stand Up to Cancer Club. Even though it was hard to balance school work and clubs, it was a year that I was able to experience many things, especially in Japanese Culture Club. Japanese Culture Club was a new club that I started from scratch with my friends. Everytime was new to me. It was hard to plan and attract others to get interested in my club. To be honest, I cannot call myself successful, but I was able to meet various people to feel connected and know there is an accomplishment after a hard work to be successful. In total, I was able to have about 150 community service hours by joining Key Club and California Scholarship Federation. This is where I gained my responsibility and leadership skills.<br><br>

        My character used to be shy and crybaby. However, I started to change myself in junior year in my high school year when my teacher told the class that participation was a requirement. I told my teacher about my difficulties for my participation. Then, he recommended me to set a goal of participation in a week to improve my courage slowly since it is difficult to participate a lot in a short period of time. Because of this method, I was able to gain confidence and speak in front of people positively.
